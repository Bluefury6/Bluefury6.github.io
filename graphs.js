The recomended(and default) difficulty is the maximum, as the lower difficulties are a bit buggy. Your score is in seconds survived when playing against the max AI setting. This graph was the first one I made using the 'experimental' features of Desmos.",

However, it lacks significant realism, as the block moves rather quickly, and no energy is ever lost due to air or water resistance. The block also will correct for variables being changed mid-flight. On the other hand, I think that the math for the heights is somewhat correct...",
